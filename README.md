# Learning from Demonstration with Temporal Logic Constraints

## Setup

This project contains the submodule "LTL_Diff", which constains the language for converting temporal logic statements into differentiable costs. To ensure this submodule is downloaded and updated correctly, make sure you run ```git clone``` with the following flag:

    git clone --recurse-submodules

Or, if you forget to do this, run the following two commands after cloning the repository:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
